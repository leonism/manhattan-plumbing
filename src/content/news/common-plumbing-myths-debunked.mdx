# 10 Common Plumbing Myths Debunked by Experts

As plumbing professionals, we often encounter misconceptions that can lead to costly mistakes or
unnecessary worries. Let's separate fact from fiction with expert analysis of common plumbing myths.

## Myth #1: Chemical Drain Cleaners Are Safe and Effective

**The Truth**: Chemical drain cleaners can actually damage your pipes and create more problems than
they solve. These harsh chemicals:

- Corrode pipe materials
- Create harmful fumes
- May not address the root cause
- Can make clogs worse

## Myth #2: A Leaky Faucet Isn't a Big Deal

**The Truth**: Even small leaks can waste thousands of gallons of water annually and lead to:

- Higher water bills
- Water damage
- Mineral buildup
- Wasted resources

## Myth #3: Hot Water Helps Grease Go Down Drains

**The Truth**: Hot water actually causes grease to:

- Liquefy temporarily
- Flow further into pipes
- Cool and solidify
- Create stubborn clogs

## Myth #4: Flushable Wipes Are Truly Flushable

**The Truth**: Despite marketing claims, so-called “flushable” wipes do not break down like toilet
paper. They often cause severe blockages and contribute to sewer backups. Instead:

- Dispose of wipes in the trash
- Avoid expensive drain clearing services
- Protect municipal wastewater systems

## Myth #5: You Can Ignore Water Heater Maintenance

**The Truth**: Neglecting your water heater can lead to reduced efficiency, higher energy bills, and
even premature failure. Regular maintenance, such as flushing the tank and checking the anode rod,
helps:

- Extend equipment lifespan
- Prevent unexpected breakdowns
- Maintain consistent hot water supply

## Myth #6: All Plumbers Are the Same

**The Truth**: Plumbing expertise and service quality vary greatly among professionals. Licensed,
experienced plumbers:

- Follow local codes and safety standards
- Provide warranties on work
- Offer thorough diagnostics and long-term solutions
- Reduce the risk of repeat problems

## Myth #7: Low Water Pressure Is Just an Annoyance

**The Truth**: Persistent low water pressure may signal underlying issues such as:

- Hidden leaks
- Corroded pipes
- Malfunctioning pressure regulators
- Blocked aerators

Ignoring these signs can lead to severe damage and costly repairs.

## Myth #8: Ice Cubes Sharpen Garbage Disposal Blades

**The Truth**: Garbage disposals don’t actually have sharp blades — they use blunt impellers to
grind food. Ice cubes can help clean debris, but they don’t sharpen anything. To maintain your
disposal:

- Use cold water during operation
- Avoid fibrous materials and grease
- Periodically grind citrus peels to freshen

## Myth #9: Running Water Helps Anything Go Down the Drain

**The Truth**: While water helps move small debris, it doesn’t prevent all clogs. Items like coffee
grounds, eggshells, and grease can still accumulate and cause major blockages. Best practices
include:

- Using sink strainers
- Disposing of grease in the trash
- Avoiding overloading the disposal

## Myth #10: DIY Plumbing Repairs Save Money

**The Truth**: While DIY fixes might seem cost-effective, improper repairs often lead to bigger,
more expensive issues down the line. Professional plumbers:

- Diagnose root causes properly
- Use the right materials and techniques
- Ensure lasting, code-compliant repairs

By understanding and dispelling these common myths, homeowners can make informed decisions that
protect both their plumbing systems and their budgets. Trusting reliable professional advice ensures
your home runs efficiently and safely.

If you have questions or suspect any issues, don’t hesitate to consult a certified plumber.
Investing in expert guidance today can prevent headaches and high costs tomorrow — empowering you to
maintain a healthier, more efficient home with confidence.
