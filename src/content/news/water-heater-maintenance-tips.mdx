# Essential Water Heater Maintenance Tips for Longevity

Your water heater is one of the hardest working appliances in your home. Regular maintenance not
only extends its lifespan but also ensures efficient operation and lower energy costs. Follow our
expert guide to keep your water heater in top condition.

## Why Regular Maintenance Matters

Regular maintenance of your water heater:

- Extends equipment lifespan
- Improves energy efficiency
- Prevents costly repairs
- Ensures consistent hot water supply
- Maintains safe operation

## Annual Maintenance Checklist

### 1. Safety Inspection

- Check pressure relief valve
- Inspect anode rod
- Test temperature settings
- Examine gas line or electrical connections

### 2. Tank Maintenance

- Flush sediment from tank
- Clean burner assembly
- Check for leaks
- Inspect heating elements

## 3. Inspect and Replace the Anode Rod

The anode rod plays a crucial role in preventing corrosion inside your water heater tank. Over time,
it deteriorates and requires replacement to keep the tank from rusting.

- Check the anode rod every one to three years.
- Replace it if more than 50% is worn or coated with calcium.
- Use a socket wrench to remove the rod and install a new one as needed.
- A healthy anode rod can significantly extend the life of your heater.

## 4. Adjust the Thermostat

Maintaining the right temperature setting helps avoid overheating, reduces energy consumption, and
prevents scalding.

- The recommended temperature is typically around 120°F (49°C).
- Lowering the temperature can reduce energy bills and minimize mineral buildup.
- Use a household thermometer to verify water temperature at the tap.

## 5. Insulate the Heater and Pipes

Insulating your water heater and the first few feet of hot and cold water pipes helps retain heat
and improve efficiency.

- Install a water heater blanket if your unit is in an unheated area.
- Use pipe insulation sleeves to reduce heat loss and prevent freezing.
- Make sure to avoid covering important components like the thermostat or burner area.

## 6. Check for Leaks and Corrosion

Periodic visual inspections can help detect small issues before they become major failures.

- Look for rust, corrosion, or pooling water around the base of the heater.
- Check all visible pipes and connections for signs of leakage.
- Tighten fittings or replace seals where necessary.

## 7. Test the Pressure Relief Valve

The temperature and pressure relief valve (T\&P valve) prevents excessive pressure buildup, which
can be dangerous.

- Lift the valve handle slightly and let it snap back; you should hear a gurgling sound as some
  water is released.
- If the valve doesn’t release water or keeps leaking afterward, it should be replaced immediately.

By implementing these practical maintenance tasks, you ensure your water heater operates safely and
efficiently for many years. A proactive approach not only protects your investment but also
guarantees a steady supply of hot water when you need it most.

If you’re unsure about performing any of these tasks yourself, consider scheduling a professional
inspection. Our specialists can help you maintain your system with precision and care, providing
peace of mind and long-term savings. Let us assist you in making your home safer, more efficient,
and more reliable — one water heater at a time.
